# SearchBucket

Represents a single bucket in a search aggregation result. Follows the [MS Graph searchBucket](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/searchbucket) resource type. 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**key** | **string** | The discrete value of the field that was used to compute the aggregation. For terms aggregations this is the field value. For range aggregations this is a string representation of the range.  | [optional] [default to undefined]
**count** | **number** | The approximate number of search matches that share the same value specified in the &#x60;key&#x60; property.  | [optional] [default to undefined]
**aggregationFilterToken** | **string** | A token containing the encoded filter that narrows search matches to this bucket. To use it, pass it as part of the &#x60;aggregationFilters&#x60; property of a subsequent &#x60;searchRequest&#x60; in the format &#x60;{field}:{aggregationFilterToken}&#x60;. The filter matches the bucket &#x60;key&#x60; exactly and case-sensitively, so the narrowed result set is the set of matches counted in this bucket.  For terms buckets the token is the key encoded as lowercase hex of its UTF-8 bytes, prefixed with &#x60;ǂǂ&#x60; (U+01C2 twice) and wrapped in double quotes, e.g. &#x60;\&quot;ǂǂ5361786f6e\&quot;&#x60; for the key &#x60;Saxon&#x60;. For range buckets the token is &#x60;range({from}, {to})&#x60; with the bounds of the matching &#x60;bucketAggregationRange&#x60;; an open lower bound is written as &#x60;min&#x60;, an open upper bound as &#x60;max&#x60; followed by &#x60;to&#x3D;\&quot;le\&quot;&#x60;, e.g. &#x60;range(min, 1980)&#x60;, &#x60;range(1980, 1990)&#x60; and &#x60;range(2010, max, to&#x3D;\&quot;le\&quot;)&#x60;. This is the same encoding MS Graph uses.  | [optional] [readonly] [default to undefined]
**libre_graph_subAggregations** | [**Array&lt;SearchAggregation&gt;**](SearchAggregation.md) | Nested aggregation results, one per sub-aggregation requested on the parent &#x60;aggregationOption&#x60;. Libregraph extension not present in MS Graph.  | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { SearchBucket } from './api';

const instance: SearchBucket = {
    key,
    count,
    aggregationFilterToken,
    libre_graph_subAggregations,
};
```
